File main.py takes as input an initial board configuration from the csv file "board.csv" and returns a solution for the N-Queens problem using BFS, A* and Hill Climbing with simulated annealing.
It allows only vertical moves of the queens. 

Refer to file main_horizontal.py to check the solution allowing both horizontal and vertical moves of queens.

Attacking_Queens.py returns the number of attacking queens given a certain board configuration. This is used as heuristic.
